# 🔐 Secure Inter-process Communication (IPC) Framework

A secure and extensible framework designed for enabling safe, efficient, and authenticated communication between processes in an operating system environment.

## 📌 Overview

In modern operating systems, **inter-process communication (IPC)** is vital for allowing processes to exchange data and synchronize actions. This project introduces a **Secure IPC Framework** that ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted between processes. It serves as a proof-of-concept for building secure OS-level communication systems.

## 🛡️ Key Features

- 🔐 **End-to-end Encryption** using symmetric/asymmetric cryptography
- ✅ **Process Authentication** and access control
- 🧩 **Modular Design** supporting multiple IPC mechanisms (pipes, message queues, shared memory)
- 📊 **Logging and Auditing** of message exchange
- 🚦 **Lightweight Protocol** for message framing and error handling

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Language: **C / C++**
- OS Concepts: **Pipes, Shared Memory, Semaphores**
- Security: **OpenSSL / Custom Encryption**
- Build System: **Makefile**
- Optional UI: **Ncurses** for CLI visualization
